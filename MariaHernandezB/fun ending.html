    <h1> Fun Ending</h1> 
   <p> As you stood up, you began to realise you accidently gifted yourself with super powers. The orb granted you powers to control the elemets of nature.  
     
     <br />
     <br />
     <h2> A Few Years Later... </h2>
      <br />
      ...You have saved so many lives and everyone knows you by the name Agent Storm. No one is yet to know your real identity, not even your family... Its a matter of time before someone figures who you are and how you obtained your powers.

     <br />  
    <br />
    Perhaps there are more people like you, gifted with powers far beyond your own.
     <br />
      <br />

     Thank you for sticking out!

     Feel free to see the alternate ending.
